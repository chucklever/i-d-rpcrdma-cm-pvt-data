This document specifies the format of RDMA-CM Private Data
exchanged between RPC-over-RDMA version 1 peers
as part of establishing a connection.
The addition of the private data payload specified in this document
is an optional extension
that does not alter the RPC-over-RDMA version 1 protocol.
This document updates RFC 8166.

<t>
The RPC-over-RDMA version 1 transport protocol
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
enables payload data transfer using
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
for upper-layer protocols based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
<xref target="RFC5531"/>.
The terms "Remote Direct Memory Access" (RDMA) and
"Direct Data Placement" (DDP) are introduced in
<xref target="RFC5040"/>.
</t>
<t>
The two most immediate shortcomings
of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 are:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Setting up an RDMA data transfer (via RDMA Read or Write) can be costly.
The small default size of messages transmitted using RDMA Send
forces the use of RDMA Read or Write operations
even for relatively small messages and data payloads.
<vspace/>
The original specification of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 provided
an out-of-band protocol for passing inline threshold values
between connected peers
<xref target="RFC5666"/>.
However,
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
eliminated support for this protocol making it unavailable for this purpose.
</t>
<t>
Unlike most other contemporary RDMA-enabled storage protocols,
there is no facility in RPC-over-RDMA version 1
that enables the use of remote invalidation
<xref target="RFC5042"/>.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 1 has no means of extending its XDR definition
in such a way that interoperability with existing implementations is preserved.
As a result, an out-of-band mechanism is needed
to help relieve these constraints
for existing RPC-over-RDMA version 1 implementations.
</t>
<t>
This document specifies a simple, non-XDR-based message format
designed to be passed between RPC-over-RDMA version 1 peers
at the time each RDMA transport connection is first established.
The mechanism assumes that the underlying RDMA transport has a
private data field that is passed between peers at connection time,
such as is present in the iWARP protocol
(described in Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC5044"/>)
or
the InfiniBand Connection Manager
<xref target="IBA"/>.
</t>
<t>
To enable current RPC-over-RDMA version 1 implementations
to interoperate with implementations that support
the private message format described in this document,
implementation of the private data message is OPTIONAL.
When the private data message has been successfully exchanged,
peers may choose to perform extended RDMA semantics.
However, the private message format
does not alter the XDR definition specified in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
</t>
<t>
The message format is intended to be further extensible
within the normal scope of such IETF work
(see
<xref target="section:96A18D5A-2AE4-490D-B140-B964302BF1DF"/>
for further details).
<xref target="section:8701C122-F206-4F87-8FA6-62F1CD648A14"/>
of the current document defines an IANA registry for this purpose.
In addition, interoperation between
implementations of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 that present this message format to peers
and those that do not recognize this message format is guaranteed.

<section
 title="Inline Threshold Size"
 anchor="section:0F60CBDD-8A7E-4B41-B193-18C04201DB3E">
<t>
Section 3.3.2 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
defines the term "inline threshold."
An inline threshold is the maximum number of bytes that
can be transmitted using one RDMA Send and one RDMA Receive.
There are a pair of inline thresholds for a connection:
a client-to-server threshold and a server-to-client threshold.
</t>
<t>
If an incoming message exceeds the size of a receiver's inline threshold,
the receive operation fails and the connection is typically terminated.
To convey a message larger than a receiver's inline threshold,
an NFS client uses explicit RDMA data transfer operations,
which are more expensive to use than RDMA Send.
</t>
<t>
The default value of inline thresholds for RPC-over-RDMA version 1
connections is 1024 bytes (see Section 3.3.3 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>).
This value is adequate for nearly all NFS version 3 procedures.
</t>
<t>
NFS version 4 COMPOUND operations
<xref target="RFC7530"/>
are larger on average
than NFS version 3 procedures
<xref target="RFC1813"/>,
forcing clients to use explicit RDMA operations
for frequently-issued requests such as LOOKUP and GETATTR.
The use of RPCSEC_GSS security also increases the average size
of RPC messages,
due to the larger size of RPCSEC_GSS credential material
included in RPC headers
<xref target="RFC7861"/>.
</t>
<t>
If a sender and receiver could somehow agree on larger inline thresholds,
frequently-used RPC transactions avoid the cost of explicit RDMA operations.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Remote Invalidation"
 anchor="section:F82BDC05-F8A6-478C-A02C-BC308EE75A18">
<t>
After an RDMA data transfer operation completes,
an RDMA consumer can use remote invalidation
to request that the remote peer RNIC
invalidate an STag
associated with the data transfer
<xref target="RFC5042"/>.
</t>
<t>
An RDMA consumer requests remote invalidation by posting
an RDMA Send With Invalidate Work Request
in place of an RDMA Send Work Request.
Each RDMA Send With Invalidate carries one STag to invalidate.
The receiver of an RDMA Send With Invalidate performs the
requested invalidation and then reports that invalidation
as part of the completion of a waiting Receive Work Request.
</t>
<t>
If both peers support remote invalidation,
an RPC-over-RDMA responder might use remote invalidation
when replying to an RPC request that provided chunks.
Because one of the chunks has already been invalidated,
finalizing the results of the RPC is made simpler and faster.
</t>
<t>
However, there are some important caveats which contraindicate
the blanket use of remote invalidation:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Remote invalidation is not supported by all RNICs.
</t>
<t>
Not all RPC-over-RDMA responder implementations can generate
RDMA Send With Invalidate Work Requests.
</t>
<t>
Not all RPC-over-RDMA requester implementations can recognize
when remote invalidation has occurred.
</t>
<t>
On one connection in different RPC-over-RDMA transactions,
or in a single RPC-over-RDMA transaction,
an RPC-over-RDMA requester can expose a mixture of STags
that may be invalidated remotely
and some that must not be.
No indication is provided at the RDMA layer as to which is which.
</t>
</list>
A responder therefore must not employ remote invalidation unless it is
aware of support for it in its own RDMA stack, and on the requester.
And, without altering the XDR structure of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 messages,
it is not possible to support remote invalidation with requesters
that mix STags that may and must not be invalidated remotely
in a single RPC or on the same connection.
</t>
<t>
There are some NFS/RDMA client implementations whose STags
are always safe to invalidate remotely.
For such clients, indicating to the responder that remote
invalidation is always safe can allow such invalidation
without the need for additional protocol to be defined.
</t>

<section
 title="Private Data Message Format"
 anchor="section:99541DF3-E579-42B6-9C7A-D020926798F6">
<t>
With an InfiniBand lower layer, for example,
RDMA connection setup uses a Connection Manager
when establishing a Reliable Connection
<xref target="IBA"/>.
When an RPC-over-RDMA version 1 transport connection is established,
the client (which actively establishes connections)
and the server (which passively accepts connections)
populate the CM Private Data field exchanged
as part of CM connection establishment.
</t>
<t>
The transport properties exchanged via this mechanism
are fixed for the life of the connection.
Each new connection presents an opportunity
for a fresh exchange.
An implementation of the extension described in this document
MUST be prepared for the settings to change upon a reconnection.
</t>
<t>
For RPC-over-RDMA version 1, the CM Private Data field
is formatted as described in the following subsection.
RPC clients and servers use the same format.
If the capacity of the Private Data field is too small
to contain this message format,
the underlying RDMA transport is not managed by a Connection Manager,
or the underlying RDMA transport uses Private Data for its own purposes,
the CM Private Data field cannot be used on behalf of RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
</t>
<t>
The first 8 octets of the CM Private Data field
is to be formatted as follows:

<section
 title="Interoperability Considerations"
 anchor="section:58229D50-C3E7-48D1-A82F-7720AC8A9F8B">
<t>
The extension described in this document is designed to allow
RPC-over-RDMA version implementations that use CM Private Data
to interoperate fully with
RPC-over-RDMA version 1 implementations that do not exchange this information.
Implementations that use this extension must also interoperate
fully with RDMA implementations that use CM Private Data for other purposes.
Realizing these goals require that implementations of this extension
follow the practices described in the rest of this section.
</t>

<section
 title="Interoperability with RPC-over-RDMA Version 1 Implementations"
 anchor="section:9A3B285D-D557-4028-ACB0-60EA1C9C93BE">
<t>
When a peer does not receive a CM Private Data message
which conforms to
<xref target="section:99541DF3-E579-42B6-9C7A-D020926798F6"/>,
it needs to act as if the remote peer supports only the
default RPC-over-RDMA version 1 settings,
as defined in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
In other words, the peer MUST behave as if a Private Data
message was received in which bit 15 of the Flags field is zero,
and both Size fields contain the value zero.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Interoperability with Implementations of Other Upper-Layer Protocols"
 anchor="section:0BD80E15-13FF-4210-A1D8-E0AE531821A4">
<t>
The Format Identifier field in the message format
defined in this document is provided to enable implementations
to distinguish RPC-over-RDMA version 1 Private Data
from private data inserted at layers below RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
An example of a layer below RPC-over-RDMA version 1 that
makes use of CM Private Data is
iWARP, via the MPA enhancement described in
<xref target="RFC6581"/>.
</t>
<t>
During connection establishment,
an implementation of the extension described in this document
checks the Format Identifier field before decoding subsequent fields.
If the RPC-over-RDMA version 1 CM Private Data Format Identifier
is not present as the first 4 octets,
an RPC-over-RDMA version 1 receiver MUST ignore the CM Private Data,
behaving as if no RPC-over-RDMA version 1 Private Data
has been provided (see above).
</t>
<t>
Because the Format Identifier field is newer
than some other potential users of private data (such as iWARP),
there is a risk that a lower layer might inject its own private data
with a payload somehow containing the identifier of RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
It is recommended that RPC-over-RDMA version 1 implementations
perform additional checks on the content of received CM private data
before making use of it.
</t>

<section
 title="Updating the Message Format"
 anchor="section:96A18D5A-2AE4-490D-B140-B964302BF1DF">
<t>
Although the message format described in this document
provides the ability for the client and server
to exchange particular information about
the local RPC-over-RDMA implementation,
it is possible that there will be a future need
to exchange additional properties.
This would make it necessary to extend or otherwise modify
the format described in this document.
</t>
<t>
Any modification faces the problem of interoperating properly
with implementations of RPC-over-RDMA version 1
that are unaware of this existence of the new format.
These include implementations that that do not recognize
the exchange of CM Private Data
as well as
those that recognize only the format described in this document.
</t>
<t>
Given the message format described in this document,
these interoperability constraints could be met by the following
sorts of new message formats:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A format which uses a different value for the first four bytes of the format,
as provided for in the registry described in
<xref target="section:8701C122-F206-4F87-8FA6-62F1CD648A14"/>.
</t>
<t>
A format which uses the same value for the Format Identifier field
and a value other than one (1) in the Version field.
</t>
</list>
Although it is possible to reorganize
the last three of the eight bytes in the existing format,
extended formats are unlikely to do so.
New formats would take the form of extensions
of the format described in this document with added fields
starting at byte eight of the format
and changes to the definition of previously reserved flags.

<section
 title="Feature Support Flags"
 anchor="section:1D624044-49CC-4464-9BEF-59EA2473ACBF">

as shown in the diagram above.
When the Version field contains the value "1",
the bits in the Flags field are to be set as follows:

<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Bit 15:">
When both connection peers have set this flag in their CM Private Data,

Each RDMA Send With Invalidate MUST invalidate an STag

of the RPC-over-RDMA Transport Header it carries.

<t>
Inline threshold sizes from 1KB to 256KB
can be represented in the Send Size and Receive Size fields.
A sender computes the encoded value by dividing
the actual value by 1024 and subtracting one from the result.
A receiver decodes this value by performing
a complementary set of operations.

The client uses the smaller of its own send size and
the server's reported receive size

the author requests that IANA create a new registry in the
"Remote Direct Data Placement"
Protocol Category Group.
The new registry is to be called the
"RDMA-CM Private Data Identifier Registry".
This is a registry of 32-bit numbers that identify
the upper-layer protocol associated with data that appears in
the application-specific RDMA-CM Private Data area.
The fields in this registry include:

 anchor="section:DB1C2628-A2D2-4EE7-8CD6-592F832C8C86">
<t>
The Designated Expert (DE), appointed by the IESG,
should ascertain the existence of suitable documentation that
defines the semantics and format of the private data,
and verify that the document is permanently and publicly available.
Documentation produced outside the IETF must not conflict
with work that is active or already published within the IETF.
</t>
<t>
The new Reference field should contain
a reference to that documentation.
The DE can assign new Format Identifiers at random
as long as they do not conflict with existing entries in this registry.
The Description field should contain the name of a
distinct upper-layer RDMA consumer that will use the private data.

<t>
The DE will post the request to the nfsv4 WG mailing list

The Private Data extension specified in this document
inherits the security considerations of the protocols it extends,
which in this case is defined in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
</t>
<t>
The integrity of CM Private Data and the authenticity of it's source
is ensured by the use of the Reliable connected (RC)
Queue Pair (QP) type, required by RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
Any attempts to interfere with or hijack an RC connection
will result in the connection being immediately terminated.
Additional relevant analysis of RDMA security appears in
the Security Considerations section of
<xref target="RFC5042"/>.

Improperly setting one of the fields in the private message payload
will result in a greatly increased risk of disconnection
(i.e., self-imposed Denial of Service).
There is no increased risk of exposing upper-layer data inappropriately.
