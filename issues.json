    "body": "I agree with Alissa.\r\n\r\nSection 4\r\n\r\n>   For RPC-over-RDMA version 1, the CM Private Data field is formatted\r\n>   as described in the following subsection.  RPC clients and servers\r\n>   use the same format.  If the capacity of the Private Data field is\r\n>   too small to contain this message format, the underlying RDMA\r\n>   transport is not managed by a Connection Manager, or the underlying\r\n>   RDMA transport uses Private Data for its own purposes, the CM Private\r\n>   Data field cannot be used on behalf of RPC-over-RDMA version 1.\r\n\r\nHow will an implementation know if \"the underlying RDMA transport uses\r\nPrivate Data for its own purposes\"?\r\n\r\nSection 5\r\n\r\n>   Although it is possible to reorganize the last three of the eight\r\n>   bytes in the existing format, extended formats are unlikely to do so.\r\n>   New formats would take the form of extensions of the format described\r\n>   in this document with added fields starting at byte eight of the\r\n>   format and changes to the definition of previously reserved flags.\r\n\r\nI would suggest making it a (mandatory) invariant of this format to\r\nretain these last three bytes' interpretation, requiring the use of a\r\ndifferent \"magic word\" for future versions that need to diverge from it.\r\nThe current text does not really give an implementation anything that it\r\ncan rely on.\r\n\r\nSection 6\r\n\r\n>   The RPC-over-RDMA version 1 protocol framework depends on the\r\n>   semantics of the Reliable Connected (RC) queue pair (QP) type, as\r\n>   defined in Section 9.7.7 of [IBA].  The integrity of CM Private Data\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to see such a reference to [IBA], when IIUC the RFC\r\n8166 protocol is not limited to Infiniband as the underlying transport.\r\n\r\n>   Additional analysis of RDMA transport security appears in the\r\n>   Security Considerations section of [RFC5042].  That document\r\n\r\nnit: the actual analysis isn't *in* the security considerations section\r\n(but is referenced from it).\r\n\r\n>   Improperly setting one of the fields in a version 1 Private Message\r\n>   can result in an increased risk of disconnection (i.e., self-imposed\r\n>   Denial of Service).  There is no additional risk of exposing upper-\r\n>   layer payloads after exchanging the Private Message format defined in\r\n>   the current document.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure where or how one might have expected such\r\nadditional exposures to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should probably mention the risk that some (other) CM-private data\r\nitem might inadvertenly produce in its payload the \"magic number\" that\r\nwe use to identify this protocol's data structure.  I *think* (but\r\nplease confirm) that erroneously doing so would lead only to (likely)\r\nRDMA-channel disconnection and could not introduce (e.g.) data\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\n>   In addition to describing the structure of a new format version, any\r\n>   document that extends the Private Data format described in the\r\n>   current document must discuss security considerations of new data\r\n>   items exchanged between connection peers.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, future extensions should consider what the risks of\r\nerroneously identifying \"random\" data as the new format would be.\r\n\r\nSection 7\r\n\r\nShould the registry also include the length of the private data?\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the previous section's comments, should prospective\r\nregistrations also be analyzing the risks to their protocol of\r\ninterpreting \"random\" data as the data structure (as would happen upon\r\nan inadvertent match of the \"magic number\")?\r\n\r\nSection 7.1\r\n\r\n>   The new Reference field should contain a reference to that\r\n>   documentation.  The DE can assign new Format Identifiers at random as\r\n>   long as they do not conflict with existing entries in this registry.\r\n\r\nRandom may not be the best choice for this, if there are ways to produce\r\nvalues that are less-likely-than-random to occur inadvertently in the\r\npayload of any of the registered formats."

This is a simple DISCUSS point that should be very\r\neasy to resolve:\r\n\r\n— Section 5.2 —\r\n\r\n  A sender computes the encoded\r\n  value by dividing the buffer size, in octets, by 1024 and subtracting\r\n  one from the result.\r\n\r\nIs the buffer size necessarily a multiple of 1024?  If so, where is that\r\nspecified?  If not, what is the encoded value when the buffer size is, say,\r\n2000?  Is it zero?  Or one?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCOMMENT:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSome purely editorial comments:\r\n\r\n— Abstract —\r\nThe abstract needs to stand alone, so you should expand the term RDMA-CM in the\r\nabstract.  (RPC doesn’t need expanding, so once you’ve expanded RDMA-CM,\r\nRPC-over-RDMA should be OK.)\r\n\r\n— Introduction —\r\nPlease expand “XDR” on first use.\r\n\r\n  Section 7 of the current document\r\n\r\n“of this document” is better, I think.\r\n\r\n— Section 3.2 —\r\nPlease expand “RNIC” and “STag”.\r\n\r\n  invalidation without the need for additional protocol to be defined.\r\n\r\nEither “an additional protocol” or “additional protocols”.\r\n\r\n— Section 4.1 —\r\n\r\n  Realizing these goals\r\n  require that implementations of this extension follow the practices\r\n\r\nThe subject is “realizing”, which is singular.  So, “requires’.\r\n\r\n— Section 5.1 —\r\n\r\n  Bits 14 - 8:  These bits are reserved and are always zero when the\r\n     Version field contains 1.\r\n\r\nIn other protocols, leaving it unspecified as to what happens if not all\r\nreserved bits are zero has caused interoperability problems.  If you know\r\nthat’s not a concern here, that’s fine.  Otherwise, it might be good to say\r\nexplicitly that either they are ignored on receipt or non-zero bits result in\r\nan error."

    "body": "Expert review called out the weaknesses of the format identifier word.\r\n\r\nReviewer:\r\n> I agree that the format specifier is useless. There are many existing users which could be setting the private data to anything.  You really need to rely on the port numbers being correct, with checks on the other fields detecting mismatched protocols.\r\n\r\nLever:\r\n> Other reviewers have been ambivalent about the format identifier, but we don't have a better solution at the moment. The problem is the port numbers are all arbitrary. AFAIK they are not used in a way that identify the connection as RPC.\r\n> The 2049 destination port number means \"NFS\" but that's a layer /above/ RPC/RDMA.\r\n\r\nTalpey:\r\n> This is not the purpose of the identifier. It is there to signal to the receiver that the payload is the one defined in the document. If the identifier is not present, the receiver will ignore the private data. This means the identifier must be defined, and present. It's not meant to be universal. Yes, there's a risk that another layer injects its own private data, with a payload somehow containing the identifier. That might warrant a sentence or two.\r\n\r\nI propose that text explaining the risks (Talpey) be introduced. In addition, it's not likely that an RPC consumer will attempt to use the CM private data. Remove mention of \"protocols above RPC/RDMA\" using it. Also, it's likely that only transport layer protocols (ie., iWARP) will use CM private data at the same time as RPC/RDMA."

I checked with Tom Talpey on this (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> TL;DR **Proposed Standard is appropriate.**\r\n> \r\n> I may be the guilty party here. When Chuck originally was exploring using private data to extend rpcrdmav1, I encouraged him to publish the format as a draft. By design, the private data is optional, for both the sender and the receiver. Its presence, and its recognition at the peer, drives the extended features.\r\n>  \r\n> At the time, the concern for standardization was whether it would be of interest to the WG, and/or to other implementations. Its adoption as a WG item settles that.\r\n>  \r\n> When published as Proposed Standard, **the document should additionally be tagged as an optional extension to RFC8166.**"

    "body": "So this private data field is only existing in Infinite Band Connection manger? So what this document is defining a structure to a field which currently don’t have any structure but are part of a protocol defined by another body?\r\n\r\nHave this work been formally agreed with IBTA?\r\n\r\nOr is the relationship to the connection manager used to establish the RPC over RDMA different, if that is the case it needs to be better explained.\r\n\r\nIs it bit 8 or bit 15 of the flags field that are used. Section 5.1 and 4.1 do not agree. The later thinks it is bit 8.\r\n\r\nSection 5: Is there only going to be one object of private data forever in the relevant communication? If not, why isn’t this a well-specified TLV so that unknow type entries can be skipped to the nest object?\r\n\r\nEven if there ever is going to be one entry, can you be more formal in description of what is a valid message using another format identifier, is that only the 32-bit field of the format Identifier, or also the version.\r\n\r\nIsn’t the version field just unnecessary? If one needs version using another format identifier is more easy than the identifier + version construct.\r\n\r\nSection 6: The IANA consideration is confusing. If the specification for a CM private data format requires IESG approval, then why have the expert review policy. In that case one can simply use the IESG approval policy instead. However, requiring any type of IESG approval here appear to be a way to high bar. I think expert review is likely appropriate, but the guidance to the Experts needs to be clearer. For example what happens if IBTA want to use this to add some format?\r\n\r\nSection 7: The security consideration. I am missing any discussion about the security requirements that the actual extension. It appears that integrity and source authenticity are required for safe operation of these two extensions.\r\n\r\nIBARCH URL Is not valid, it results in a 404."
